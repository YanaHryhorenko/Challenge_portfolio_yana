# Task 1: software configuration
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hello, my name is Yana. I completed a manual testing course and realized that this is exactly what I want to do. I decided to move on and get automation knowledge using the Internet, but there was no result. When I saw this challenge, I knew it was my chance.

My main goal is to acquire knowledge and learn from the experience of professionals. I want to understand automation and apply the acquired knowledge in practice. I am sure that this challenge will be interesting and useful for all participants and for me personally.
#### Thank you for such a great opportunity to learn automation!
